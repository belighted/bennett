  # twice as many worker_processes as you have configured.

  # This allows a new master process to incrementally
  # phase out the old master process with SIGTTOU to avoid a
  # thundering herd (especially in the "preload_app false" case)
  # when doing a transparent upgrade.  The last worker spawned
  # will then kill off the old master process with a SIGQUIT.
